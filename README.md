# Remove Zero Values in GridView

This code snippet demonstrates how to remove zero values in a GridView control by replacing them with empty strings. It iterates through the rows of the GridView and checks if any TextBox controls contain a value of "0". If a TextBox contains "0", it replaces the value with an empty string.
